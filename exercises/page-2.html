        <p>In a city where the skies often weep and the streets shimmer with reflections, the rain is more than weather—it’s memory. Each drop carries a story, each puddle a forgotten moment. Purple Rain is not just a storm; it’s a feeling, a soundtrack to solitude and connection.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to a journey through sound and emotion. This page explores the essence of Purple Rain—not only as a song, but as a symbol of vulnerability, passion, and transformation. Whether you're here for design practice or lyrical inspiration, let the rhythm guide your creativity.</p>

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>The phrase "Purple Rain" evokes a blend of melancholy and beauty. It first appeared in pop culture through music, but its meaning transcends genres. Purple, the color of royalty and mystery, meets rain, the element of cleansing and renewal. Together, they form a poetic paradox.</p>

        <h2>Visual Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Imagine a city bathed in violet light, raindrops catching neon reflections, and silence broken only by distant melodies. This is the aesthetic of Purple Rain—moody, cinematic, and timeless. Use this imagery to inspire your layout, your typography, and your color palette.</p>
