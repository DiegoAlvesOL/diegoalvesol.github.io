        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello there! I'm <strong>Diego Alves de Oliveira</strong>, but you can call me <em>Diego Skywalker</em> a playful nod to my journey as a learner exploring the universe of technology.
            I'm currently studying <strong>Frontend Development</strong> and building my foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and soon <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created this website as a small digital hangar to practice web design, showcase some exercises, and share my learning path through the Force of code.
