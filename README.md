# 🌌 **Diego Skywalker | Frontend Explorer**

**Live Demo:** [diegoalvesol.github.io](https://diegoalvesol.github.io)

Welcome to my first website a small corner of the web where I'm learning, building, and having fun while exploring the galaxy of **Frontend Development**.

> “May the code be clean, and the Force be with you.” ✨

## **About the Project**

This project was created as part of my **academic journey in Frontend Development**.  
It’s a personal space to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and soon **JavaScript**, while learning how to structure, style, and share modern web pages.

The nickname **"Diego Skywalker"** represents my journey as a *Padawan Developer* discovering new skills, overcoming bugs, and enjoying the path toward becoming a **Frontend Jedi** 🧑‍💻🪐

Each page in this project is like a new mission in the *Academy of Code*.

## 💡 **What I’ve Learned So Far**

- How to structure a webpage using **semantic HTML5**
- How to apply **global and consistent styles** with CSS
- How to **organize project files** clearly for scalability
- How to **use Git & GitHub** for versioning and collaboration

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add new pages with different layouts
- Experiment with responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Add JavaScript to make interactions dynamic
- Customize theme colors and fonts (maybe a Star Wars-inspired theme 🌠)

---

## 🧩 **Academic Context**

This website also serves as a repository for my college learning journey.  
In the upcoming updates, I’ll include a **Private Studies section** where I’ll share personal Markdown notes (like Git, Linux, and command cheatsheets).  
Some pages will display animations, interactive elements, or educational GIFs to reinforce what I’m learning in class. 📚
