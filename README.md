# 🌌 Diego Skywalker | Frontend Explorer
diegoalvesol.github.io

Welcome to my first website a small corner of the web where I'm learning, building, and having fun while exploring the galaxy of **Frontend Development**.

> “May the code be clean, and the Force be with you.” ✨

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was created as part of my **Frontend learning journey**.  
It’s a space to experiment with **HTML** and **CSS**, and soon **JavaScript**, while learning how to structure and style modern web pages.

The theme “Diego Skywalker” is a fun nickname to represent my adventure as a Padawan in the world of code.  
Each page here is a new mission in my training to become a *Frontend Jedi* 🧑‍💻🪐
